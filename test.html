                    <h2>Statement</h2>
                    It has been a honor and a privilege to serve on the CoBank board the past four years. From
                    growing up on a family farm, custom harvesting, auditing cooperatives and becoming a
                    controller, to CFO and then CEO for several large cooperatives, I have built a well rounded
                    career in the business and agriculture industry. As a CoBank director, I strive to
                    constantly evaluate new opportunities and identify what will bring the greatest benefit and
                    value to CoBank patrons. With CoBank’s continued support, the development of our agriculture
                    and rural infrastructure, along with identifying potential sources for financial growth,
                    will be critical for our rural communities and businesses to be successful. I look forward
                    to the opportunity to continuing serving the local patrons and owners as a re-elected CoBank
                    director.

                        <h2>Faith & Morals</h2>
                        My faith in God and being a Christian holds immense importance for me. It serves as
                        my guiding light, helping me make correct, true, and moral decisions. In debates with
                        atheists, I’ve been asked whether one must be a Christian to make moral choices. My
                        response is that while it’s not a prerequisite, having God as a guiding compass certainly
                        makes the journey easier.

                        <h2>Family Values</h2>
                        I firmly believe in the strength of family bonds. According to my convictions, God has
                        placed us here to form families, raise children, and contribute to the growth of His
                        kingdom. As a man, I recognize my responsibility to protect and care for my wife and
                        kids. I strive to set a positive example for my children, teaching them right from wrong.

                        Consider me a patriot. I am profoundly grateful to have been born in the U.S.A. I can’t
                        imagine a better place to love my wife and raise my kids. Our freedom is a precious gift,
                        and we owe a debt of gratitude to our founding fathers for creating this remarkable
                        country. Let us always remember our history and the values we stand for. God Bless the
                        USA.
