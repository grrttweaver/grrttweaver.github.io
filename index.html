                            <h2>Statement</h2>
                            It has been a honor and a privilege to serve on the CoBank board the past four years. From
                            growing up on a family farm, custom harvesting, auditing cooperatives and becoming a
                            controller, to CFO and then CEO for several large cooperatives, I have built a well rounded
                            career in the business and agriculture industry. As a CoBank director, I strive to
                            constantly evaluate new opportunities and identify what will bring the greatest benefit and
                            value to CoBank patrons. With CoBank’s continued support, the development of our agriculture
                            and rural infrastructure, along with identifying potential sources for financial growth,
                            will be critical for our rural communities and businesses to be successful. I look forward
                            to the opportunity to continuing serving the local patrons and owners as a re-elected CoBank
                            director.

                            <h3>Faith & Morals</h3>
                            My faith in God and being a Christian holds immense importance for me. It serves as<br />
                            my guiding light, helping me make correct, true, and moral decisions. In debates with<br />
                            atheists, I’ve been asked whether one must be a Christian to make moral choices. My<br />
                            response is that while it’s not a prerequisite, having God as a guiding compass certainly<br />
                            makes the journey easier.<br />

                            <h3>Family Values</h3>
                            I firmly believe in the strength of family bonds. According to my convictions, God has<br />
                            placed us here to form families, raise children, and contribute to the growth of His<br />
                            kingdom. As a man, I recognize my responsibility to protect and care for my wife and<br />
                            kids. I strive to set a positive example for my children, teaching them right from wrong.<br />

                            My wife, Kris, and I are celebrating 36 years of marriage this year. We reside in Seneca,<br />
                            KS, and are blessed with seven children and four grandchildren. Each day, I express<br />
                            gratitude for the opportunities this great nation has provided us. <br />

                            Consider me a patriot. I am profoundly grateful to have been born in the U.S.A. I can’t<br />
                            imagine a better place to love my wife and raise my kids. Our freedom is a precious gift,<br />
                            and we owe a debt of gratitude to our founding fathers for creating this remarkable<br />
                            country. Let us always remember our history and the values we stand for. God Bless the<br />
