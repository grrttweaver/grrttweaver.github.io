                            It has been an honor to serve on the CoBank board for the past 4 years. Serving the patrons and owners of CoBank has been a valuable experience. From growing up on a farm, custom harvesting, and auditing cooperatives to becoming a controller, CFO and then CEO for several large cooperatives, business in all aspects has been my entire career. As a CoBank director, I strive to constantly evaluate the opportunities in front of us and identify what will bring the greatest benefit for the CoBank patrons. With CoBankâ€™s continued support, the development of our ag and rural infrastructure along with identifying potential sources for financial growth will be critical for our rural communities and businesses to thrive. I look forward to continuing to serve on the CoBank board.
