                            <h2>Statement</h2>
                            It has been a honor and a privilege to serve on the CoBank board the past four years. From
                            growing up on a family farm, custom harvesting, auditing cooperatives and becoming a
                            controller, to CFO and then CEO for several large cooperatives, I have built a well rounded
                            career in the business and agriculture industry. As a CoBank director, I strive to
                            constantly evaluate new opportunities and identify what will bring the greatest benefit and
                            value to CoBank patrons. With CoBankâ€™s continued support, the development of our agriculture
                            and rural infrastructure, along with identifying potential sources for financial growth,
                            will be critical for our rural communities and businesses to be successful. I look forward
                            to the opportunity to continuing serving the local patrons and owners as a re-elected CoBank
                            director.
